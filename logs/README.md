# Logs Directory

This directory stores comprehensive log files generated by The PDFinator tool, providing detailed tracking of all PDF processing operations.

## Purpose

Log files serve multiple purposes:
- **Operation Tracking**: Record all PDF processing activities
- **Error Diagnosis**: Detailed error messages and stack traces
- **Performance Monitoring**: Processing times and resource usage
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of file operations
- **Debugging**: Technical details for troubleshooting

## Log File Format

Each application run creates a timestamped log file:

```
pdf_processing_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
```

**Example**: `pdf_processing_2025-01-19_14-30-45.log`

## Log Levels

- **INFO**: Normal operations (file processing, successful operations)
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues (missing dependencies, partial failures)
- **ERROR**: Operation failures (file not found, permission errors)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed technical information (page processing, decryption attempts)

## Sample Log Entries

## Log Management

### Automatic Features
- **Timestamped Files**: Each session creates a unique log file
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Proper handling of international characters
- **Structured Format**: Consistent timestamp and message format
- **Both Console and File**: Messages appear in GUI and log files

### Manual Maintenance
- **Archive Old Logs**: Move old files to archive folders
- **Delete Unnecessary Logs**: Remove logs from test runs
- **Monitor Disk Space**: Large operations create larger log files
- **Backup Important Logs**: Save logs from critical operations

## Troubleshooting with Logs

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Check file access permissions
2. **Decryption Failures**: Review password attempts and encryption types
3. **Missing Files**: Verify file paths and existence
4. **Processing Errors**: Look for stack traces and error details

### Log Analysis Tips
- **Search by Timestamp**: Find operations from specific times
- **Filter by Level**: Focus on ERROR entries for problems
- **Track File Names**: Follow specific files through processing
- **Monitor Patterns**: Identify recurring issues

## File Permissions

Ensure the logs directory has proper write permissions:
- **Windows**: Full control for user account
- **macOS/Linux**: Write permissions (755 or 775)
- **Network Drives**: Appropriate network permissions

## Privacy and Security

- **No Sensitive Data**: Logs don't contain PDF content or passwords
- **File Paths Only**: Only file names and paths are recorded
- **Safe to Share**: Logs can be shared for technical support
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove logs containing sensitive file names if needed

By monitoring these logs, you can ensure smooth PDF processing operations and quickly identify any issues that need attention.
