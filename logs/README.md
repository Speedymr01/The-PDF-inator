# Logs Directory

This directory is designated for storing log files generated by the PDF Consolidator tool.

## Purpose

The log files provide detailed information about all PDF processing tasks performed by the tool, including any errors encountered. These logs are useful for debugging and tracking the progress of your PDF operations.

## Log Files

Each run of the tool creates a new log file in this directory, named in the format:

```
pdf_processing_manipulator_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
```

Log entries include timestamps, log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR), and descriptive messages for each significant event.

## Example Log Entry

```
2025-05-27 14:30:12 - INFO - Merged PDFs into output/document/document_merged.pdf
2025-05-27 14:31:05 - ERROR - Error deleting page 2 from document.pdf: [Error message]
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the logs directory has write permissions so the tool can create and update log files.
- Regularly check the log files to monitor the status of PDF processing tasks and to identify any issues.
- Log files can grow large over time; consider archiving or deleting old logs if you process many PDFs.

By keeping track of the logs, you can ensure that PDF processing tasks are running smoothly and efficiently.
