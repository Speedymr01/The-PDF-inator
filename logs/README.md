# Logs Directory

This directory is designated for storing log files generated by the PDF processing scripts.

## Purpose

The log files provide detailed information about the processing tasks performed by the scripts, including any errors encountered. These logs are useful for debugging and tracking the progress of the PDF processing tasks.

## Log Files

The main log file is `pdf_processing.log`, which contains entries for each significant event during the execution of the scripts. The log entries include timestamps, log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR), and descriptive messages.

## Example Log Entry

```
2023-10-01 12:00:00 - INFO - Created split PDF: output/SPLIT - document/split_1.pdf
2023-10-01 12:01:00 - ERROR - Error during OCR: [Error message]
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the log directory has write permissions so that the scripts can create and update log files.
- Regularly check the log files to monitor the status of the PDF processing tasks and to identify any issues that may need attention.
- Log files can grow large over time, so consider implementing a log rotation strategy if you process a large number of PDFs.

By keeping track of the logs, you can ensure that the PDF processing tasks are running smoothly and efficiently.
