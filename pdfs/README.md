# PDF Processing Folder

This folder is designated for storing PDF files that need to be processed. The files placed in this directory will be subject to various processing tasks as defined by the scripts and programs within this project.

## Usage

1. Place the PDF files that you want to process into this folder.
2. Ensure that the filenames and formats are correct as per the processing requirements.
3. Run the processing scripts to handle the PDFs accordingly.

## Notes

- Make sure that the PDF files are not corrupted and are in the correct format.
- The processing scripts will automatically detect and process the PDFs in this folder (while .py file is running).
- Check the output directory for the results of the processing tasks.
