# Output Directory

This directory is designated for storing the output files generated by the PDF Consolidator tool.

## Structure

The output directory will contain subdirectories and files based on the processing tasks performed. Below is an explanation of the structure and the types of files you can expect:

### Output Organization

- For each processed PDF, a subdirectory named after the original PDF (without extension) will be created in `output/`.
- All processed files related to that PDF (split pages, merged, deleted, duplicated, or OCR results) will be stored in this subdirectory.

#### Example

If your input PDF file is named `document.pdf`, the output directory will contain a subdirectory named `document`:

```
output/
└── document/
    ├── document_page_1.pdf
    ├── document_page_2.pdf
    ├── document_merged.pdf
    ├── document_deleted.pdf
    ├── document_duplicated.pdf
    ├── document_ocr.txt
```

- `document_page_1.pdf`, `document_page_2.pdf`, ...: Individual pages from splitting.
- `document_merged.pdf`: Result of merging with another PDF.
- `document_deleted.pdf`: PDF after deleting a page.
- `document_duplicated.pdf`: PDF after duplicating a page.
- `document_ocr.txt`: Text file containing extracted text from the original PDF using OCR (PyMuPDF).

## Notes

- Ensure that input PDF files are not password-protected, as the tool may not be able to process them.
- Large PDF files may take longer to process.
- OCR is performed using PyMuPDF (`fitz`) and outputs a `.txt` file with extracted text for the whole PDF.
- Check the log files in the `logs` directory for detailed information about processing tasks and any errors encountered.
