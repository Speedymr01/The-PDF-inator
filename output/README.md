# Output Directory

This directory is designated for storing the output files generated by the PDF processing scripts.

## Structure

The output directory will contain subdirectories and files based on the processing tasks performed. Below is an explanation of the structure and the types of files you can expect:

### Split PDF Files

When you run the `pdf-solutions.py` script to split a PDF file, a subdirectory will be created within the `output` directory. The subdirectory will be named `SPLIT - <filename>`, where `<filename>` is the name of the input PDF file without its extension.

For example, if your input PDF file is named `document.pdf`, the output directory will contain a subdirectory named `SPLIT - document`.

Inside this subdirectory, you will find the split PDF files named `split_1.pdf`, `split_2.pdf`, etc., each containing the specified number of pages.

### OCR Output Files

If you choose to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the split PDF files, another subdirectory named `ocr_output` will be created within the split PDF subdirectory.

For example, if your input PDF file is named `document.pdf`, the OCR output files will be located in `output/SPLIT - document/ocr_output`.

Inside this `ocr_output` subdirectory, you will find text files named `split_1.txt`, `split_2.txt`, etc., corresponding to the split PDF files. These text files contain the extracted text from the respective PDF files.

## Example

Here is an example of the directory structure after processing a PDF file named `document.pdf`:
```
output/
└── SPLIT - document/
    ├── split_1.pdf
    ├── split_2.pdf
    ├── ...
    └── ocr_output/
        ├── split_1.txt
        ├── split_2.txt
        ├── ...
```

This structure helps in organizing the output files efficiently, making it easier to locate and manage the results of your PDF processing tasks.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input PDF files are not password-protected, as the scripts may not be able to process them.
- The OCR functionality requires an internet connection to access the OCR service.
- Large PDF files may take longer to process, so please be patient.
- Check the log files in the `logs` directory for detailed information about the processing tasks and any errors encountered.
